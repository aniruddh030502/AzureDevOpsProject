Multi-Region Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Hybrid Cloud
This repository contains the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for deploying a robust, highly available, secure, and observable cloud infrastructure on Microsoft Azure. The primary objective of this project is to establish a resilient platform for hosting containerized applications (microservices) across multiple geographical regions, seamlessly integrating with on-premises environments, and providing centralized operational insights. Terraform is utilized for defining and managing all infrastructure components.

Architecture Overview
The core of this architecture is a multi-region Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deployment, designed for global availability and disaster recovery.

Global Traffic Management: Azure Traffic Manager acts as the intelligent global entry point, routing user traffic to the most performant and available AKS cluster.

Regional AKS Deployments: Two distinct AKS clusters are deployed in separate Azure regions (e.g., Central US and West US 3), each within its own Virtual Network (VNet) with dedicated public and private subnets. This provides geographic redundancy for your applications.

Cross-Region Connectivity: VNet peering enables secure, low-latency private communication directly between the two regional Azure networks.

Hybrid Cloud Integration: A simulated on-premises network is connected to the Azure environment via a secure Site-to-Site VPN, demonstrating secure hybrid cloud connectivity for data exchange between cloud-hosted applications and on-premises resources.

Centralized Services: Key shared services include an existing Azure Container Registry (ACR) for image management, Azure Key Vault for secure secrets storage, and Azure Monitor (with Log Analytics Workspace) for comprehensive logging, metrics, and diagnostics across the entire infrastructure.

Key Features & Benefits
This architecture delivers significant advantages for cloud-native application deployment:

High Availability & Disaster Recovery: Leveraging multi-region AKS and Azure Traffic Manager ensures that your applications remain accessible and performant even during regional outages, providing robust business continuity.

Enhanced Security: Network segmentation (public/private subnets), Network Security Groups (NSGs), Azure Key Vault for secrets management, and Managed Identities for secure Azure resource access collectively form a strong security posture. The Site-to-Site VPN encrypts hybrid traffic.

Optimal Performance: Traffic Manager's performance-based routing directs users to the geographically closest and healthiest application instance, minimizing latency.

Hybrid Connectivity: Seamless and secure integration with on-premises environments allows applications to securely access on-premises data or services.

Operational Efficiency: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform ensures consistent, repeatable, and automated deployments, reducing manual effort and potential errors.

Comprehensive Observability: Centralized logging and monitoring with Azure Monitor provide deep insights into application and infrastructure health, facilitating proactive issue identification and rapid troubleshooting.

Technologies Used
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): Container orchestration platform.

Azure Virtual Network (VNet): Foundational networking service.

Azure Container Registry (ACR): Private Docker image registry.

Azure Traffic Manager: Global DNS-based load balancing and traffic routing.

Azure Key Vault: Secure secrets and certificate management.

Azure VPN Gateway: Enables Site-to-Site VPN for hybrid connectivity.

Azure Monitor & Log Analytics Workspace: Centralized logging, metrics, and analytics.

Terraform: Infrastructure as Code tool for provisioning and managing Azure resources.

Python: Example language for microservices (e.g., vote).

Coverage.py: Python code coverage tool for CI pipelines.

Azure DevOps Pipelines: For Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) workflows.

SonarQube/SonarCloud: For automated static code analysis, quality gates, and code quality/security reporting within CI pipelines.

New Relic: For comprehensive Application Performance Monitoring (APM), Kubernetes monitoring, distributed tracing, and overall observability.

Implement CI/CD Pipelines with Azure DevOps
Configure Azure DevOps Pipelines (azure-pipelines.yml examples are expected in this repo):

Individual CI Pipelines: Set up separate CI pipelines for each microservice (vote, result, worker, backend) to trigger on code pushes. These pipelines will:

Build the application code.

Run unit tests (e.g., using coverage.py for Python services).

Perform static code analysis with SonarQube/SonarCloud to enforce code quality and security gates.

Build Docker images for the microservices.

Push container images to the Azure Container Registry (ACR).

Publish test results and code coverage reports as pipeline artifacts.

Multi-Stage CD Pipelines: Extend the YAML pipelines to include deployment stages.

These stages will pull the latest container images from ACR.

Apply updated Kubernetes manifests to deploy or update your microservices on the respective AKS clusters (e.g., Development, Staging, Production environments).

Implement manual approvals for critical deployments.

Enhance Observability with New Relic
Integrate New Relic for deep application and infrastructure monitoring:

New Relic Agents: Deploy New Relic APM agents alongside your microservices (e.g., Python agent for vote) to collect application-level performance metrics, transaction traces, and error details.

Kubernetes Integration: Configure New Relic's Kubernetes integration to monitor your AKS clusters, nodes, and pods, providing insights into resource utilization, events, and health.

Unified Dashboards & Alerts: Leverage New Relic's platform to create custom dashboards, visualize distributed traces across your microservices, and set up proactive alerts based on application performance, errors, or infrastructure health metrics. This complements the Azure Monitor logs collected by the azurerm_log_analytics_workspace.

By following these steps, you will establish a robust, end-to-end cloud-native platform on Azure, enabling efficient development, secure deployment, and comprehensive monitoring of your microservices.
